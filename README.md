#TuringTyper   
##Autotyper meant to pass a Turing Test of typing in a human-like way with errors and variation   
      
###Features:      
 1. Normally distributed key press length   
 2. Normally distributed time between key presses   
 3. Variable rate of typing errors   
 4. Variable rate of error correction and keypresses after error until backtracking   
 5. Hoykeys for starting and stopping the autotyper without having to click the GUI
